## Roman CPP - Observation Planning WG Meeting Notes

### 2024-05-28

My Notes:

- Back channel observations through MagAO-X, LBTI, and SHARK-NIR
    - One of them is an obvious binary, was missed in initial vetting
- Gemini-South $\rho$ Pup & $\beta$ TrA speckle imaging
    - Imaging suggests no companions
    - Inner angle on imaging $0.1"$.
        - $\rho$ Pup $\rightarrow$ 1.945 AU
        - $\beta$ TrA $\rightarrow$ 1.2 AU

Other thoughts:

- Go through and look at TESS light curves for all reference star candidates to see if there is any behavior suggestive of unseen companions in the LCs.
- Maybe also go through and re-visit the catalogs for double stars (WDS, Tycho) and double-check we didn't accidentally include any known double stars?
- Justin is going to get me the MagAO-X data and maybe some CHARA data to start reducing from Alex Greenbaum.
